# My personal professional website
So far this project is just me tinkering around with html and css. Eventually I'll get to the point where I know what I'm doing enough to refine it and actually add some good content. Most of the learning comes from the [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp 2020](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)
